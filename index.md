title: COM-301 New Media Maps
---


In this course we are going to **critically analyze** maps, spatial data, and geo stories;
looking at how the unique aesthetics of multmedia art, interaction design, and data are combined
in digital maps. During **seminars** we will engage in close readings and discussions of significant
works on spatial justice and critical cartography. We will draw upon intellectual tools that allow
us to examine spatial information to develop new insights into critical issues of racial segregation,
environment degradation, and increasing polarized political discussions. During **labs** we will
develop our own creative and interpretations of spatial data in order to build powerful digital
maps to help others understand these important issues.
